# Known issue that has been raised to US Steering Committee, as all instances of Dental Findings are not expected to conform to one of US Core Observation profiles. 
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles. Comparison with US Core Pediatric Head Occipital-frontal Circumference Percentile Profile. Comparison with US Core Pediatric BMI for Age Observation Profile. Comparison with US Core Pediatric Weight for Height Observation Profile. Comparison with US Core Blood Pressure Profile. Comparison with US Core BMI Profile. Comparison with US Core Body Height Profile. Comparison with US Core Body Temperature Profile. Comparison with US Core Body Weight Profile. Comparison with US Core Head Circumference Profile. Comparison with US Core Heart Rate Profile. Comparison with US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile. Comparison with US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. Comparison with US Core Respiratory Rate Profile. Comparison with US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile.
