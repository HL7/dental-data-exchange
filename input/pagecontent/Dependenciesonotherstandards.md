This Implementation Guide is based upon the prior work from the US Core and CCDA-on-FHIR Implementation Guides. This Implementation Guide is supported by the Da Vinci initiative which is a private effort to accelerate the adoption of Health Level Seven International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7� FHIR�) as the standard to support and integrate value-based care (VBC) data exchange across communities. As an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide, changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring Payer/Provider Information Exchange (PPIE) workgroup and are incorporated as part of the standard balloting process.
